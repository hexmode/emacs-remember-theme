# Emacs - Remember Theme

I keep my `.emacs` in source control, and use the same defaults on all
the machines I use. However, I like to have different themes on
different machines.

To help me do this automatically I've created this little feature that
remembers the current theme when Emacs closes, and loads it again when
you start up.

If you install via elpa (marmalade repo) everything is set up for you
automatically.

Just install with: `M-x package-install remember-theme`
